# Bayesian Weighted Clymo

This is a variation of the acrotelm and catotelm modelling approach. In the traditional approach a "hard" boundary is chosen and two different Clymo approaches are fitted to the data. In order to allow for a more realistic transition, this approach considers a weigh function ($w(x)$), which range is between 0 and 1 and domain is within the length of the core. In this model, two Clymo models are assumed to affect the core and then weighted by $w(x)$. Function $w(x)$ is assumed to be monotonic in order to coincide with the idea that for peat which is below the water-table only ca totem effects take effect.
